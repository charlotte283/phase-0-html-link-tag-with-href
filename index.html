        <p id="main_paragraph">When you take a look at an entire HTML document, it's sometimes challenging
         to keep track of where tags begin and end. But understanding more about HTML tag 
        nesting and attributes can help everything fall into place"></p>
         <p class="other_paragraphs">HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control 
         the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An 
         attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides 
         functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. 
         In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.</p>
